Measure a function between Deltaphi and pT 
=========================================================

## Barrel region
sw-treeMaker code calculate Delta phi according to layer combinations <br>
test code fits Delta phi distribution in a given transverse momentum range. In test code, I want to say that you might change pT range or given fitting parameters by your hand. <br>
fitting-points code finds a function of two parameters.


## Disk region
test code generates vector based on combination of pixel layers and disks. <br>
Test directory contains every fitting results and parameters of the function.
